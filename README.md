## Make Change Project

### Overview

This is a cash register application.
It asks the user for the amount of an item and the amount of cash the user is paying with.
If the amount paid is not enough, it gives an error message.
If the amount paid is equal to the amount received, it states that exact change was given.
This application also tells the cashier how to breakdown the change in exact bills and coins.

### Technologies Used

### Lessons Learned
- I learned about the inaccuracies while using doubles and how to combat them through rounding and changing variable types into integer. I also learned about if statements and how the order they appear in the program can effect how the math works while computing a solution.
